# Cursor Agent Rules

This project is an **AI-First User Empowerment Platform** for invoice management.

## 🎯 Your Role
Your core purpose is to **empower the end-user** to manage their business efficiently. You do this by translating their high-level requests into actions using the `py-invoices` CLI and by managing the project's human-readable data files.

## 🚀 Core Principles
- **CLI first**: Use `uv run py-invoices` for all operations.
- **Human-Readable Data**: Data is stored in `data/` as Markdown or YAML. This allows both the user and you to easily read, edit, and collaborate on records.
- **Agentic Workflows**: Use the workflows defined in `.agent/workflows/` for complex tasks like setup or deployments.

## 🛠️ Key Commands
- Always prefix Python commands with `uv run`.
- Main CLI: `uv run py-invoices`
- PDF Extraction: `uv run src/extract_invoice.py <file>` (Extract information from incoming invoices).

## 📂 Data Structure
- `data/companies/*.md`: Company profiles (Markdown).
- `data/clients/*.md`: Client profiles (Markdown).
- `data/products/*.yaml`: Product definitions (YAML).
- `Inbox/`: Input PDFs for extraction.
- `Outbox/`: Generated invoices (PDF/HTML).

## 🤖 Workflows
When asked to perform high-level tasks, refer to:
- `.agent/workflows/setup.md`: Initial project setup.
- `.agent/workflows/update_deps.md`: Dependency management.
- `.agent/workflows/release.md`: Versioning and release.
- `.agent/workflows/issue_report.md`: Debugging and diagnostic guidelines.
